# ML_Project_Coursera

This is the project for "Practical Machine Learning" course in Coursera.

In this project, first of all we split the data into train and test set; Then we standardized the variables and removerd the columns which were mostly NAs and also the columns which mostly had the same value in each case; Then we found the high correlated variables and removed them to have a clean data frame with enough columns.
We did the PCA process and got help from 3 algorithms: Random Forrest,SVM and Boosting.
Then we combined these models to have a better prediction model.
